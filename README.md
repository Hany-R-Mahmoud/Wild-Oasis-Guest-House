📋 About The Project
The Wild Oasis is a comprehensive internal management application designed for a boutique hotel. It provides staff with a centralized dashboard to manage bookings, cabins, and guests efficiently. The application is built entirely on the front-end using React and leverages Supabase for its backend-as-a-service needs, including database, authentication, and storage.

This project was developed to practice and showcase a wide range of modern React ecosystem tools, focusing on professional application architecture, state management, and data handling.
